# West Elm Markup Challenge

In this challenge you'll be building a webpage from scratch. Refer to the image titled `markup-challenge.jpg` while putting your page together. Feel free to use the images provided, or use your own optimized images. Dazzle us with your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills by

* Using the small product images to update the large hero product image.
* Expanding and collapsing the sections on the lower right quadrant of the page.
* Display a modal or message after the Add to Cart button is clicked.

If your markup challenge submission requires extra steps to be viewed (rather than just opening an html file in a browser), please consider adding a few notes describing the process. _Spend as long, or as little, time as you see fit but please email email us back with your expected finish date within 24 hours of receiving access to this._
 
We are looking forward to receiving your submission.
